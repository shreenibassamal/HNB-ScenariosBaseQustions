## üß© 1. Manual Testing ‚Äî Real-time Scenarios

| **Scenario Question** | **Best Answer (Manual Tester)** |
| --- | --- |
| **1\. A bug is not reproducible in your system but reported by client. What will you do?** | I‚Äôll check environment differences (browser, version, OS, test data). Ask for steps, logs, or screenshots. Try to reproduce in similar setup. If still not reproducible, involve dev/support to compare configs. |
| **2\. Login page allows invalid credentials once. How will you test?** | I‚Äôll retest multiple login attempts with invalid credentials, clear cookies/cache, check for session handling, and verify DB changes. Also test in different browsers. |
| **3\. You found a critical bug just before release. What will you do?** | Immediately log it with severity ‚ÄúCritical‚Äù, inform TL/PM, and join triage meeting to decide release go/no-go. Provide workaround if any. |
| **4\. How will you test an e-commerce ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù feature?** | Positive: Add valid items. Negative: Add out-of-stock item, invalid quantity, remove item. Check UI updates, DB cart count, and total calculation. |
| **5\. You have less time to test, but many test cases pending.** | Prioritize based on risk, business impact, and core functionality. Execute smoke & sanity first. Defer low priority to next cycle. |
| **6\. A bug is marked ‚ÄúNot a Bug‚Äù by developer, but you disagree.** | Reproduce it with steps, attach evidence (screenshot/video/log), explain business impact. Discuss politely with dev/lead. |
| **7\. How do you test without requirements (no documents)?** | Explore the application, use exploratory testing, refer to similar modules, check UI hints, and communicate with BA or devs for understanding. |
| **8\. How to test file upload functionality?** | Verify valid/invalid file types, size limits, error message, progress bar, upload speed, and file integrity after upload. |
| **9\. What will you do if test data is not available?** | Create mock data manually or via SQL scripts, coordinate with DB admin or BA to get sample data. Document test data assumptions. |
| **10\. How do you ensure test coverage?** | By mapping requirements ‚Üí test cases in **RTM (Requirement Traceability Matrix)** and reviewing with stakeholders. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Automation Testing ‚Äî Real-time Scenarios

| **Scenario Question** | **Best Answer (Automation Tester)** |
| --- | --- |
| **1\. Login automation test fails intermittently. What will you do?** | Check for synchronization issues (add explicit waits), verify locator stability, environment load, and dynamic elements. Use retry logic or FluentWait. |
| **2\. Your Selenium test works locally but fails in Jenkins.** | Possible reasons: environment path, browser driver mismatch, headless mode issues, or missing credentials. I‚Äôll debug Jenkins logs, ensure proper workspace and driver setup. |
| **3\. How will you handle dynamic elements in Selenium?** | Use XPath with `contains()`, `starts-with()`, or dynamic attributes. Use relative locators or JavaScriptExecutor if necessary. |
| **4\. Your automation test takes too long to run. How do you optimize?** | Remove redundant waits, reuse browser sessions, use parallel execution via TestNG, and implement Page Object Model. |
| **5\. How do you handle pop-ups or alerts?** | Use `driver.switchTo().alert().accept()` or `dismiss()`. For window pop-ups, handle using window handles. |
| **6\. Your automation test passes but functionality fails manually. Why?** | Possibly false positive ‚Äî locator might find wrong element, or validation missing. I‚Äôll add proper assertions and validations. |
| **7\. Jenkins job fails after update. How to debug?** | Check Jenkins console logs, verify test environment, dependencies (Maven), credentials, and recent commits. Rerun manually to isolate issue. |
| **8\. How to test multiple stores/branches using single automation suite?** | Use data-driven testing (Excel/JSON) to feed different store IDs. Configure environment in Jenkins parameterized build. |
| **9\. How do you manage locators in framework?** | Store in Page Object classes or Object Repository. Follow single responsibility and avoid duplication. |
| **10\. Your API automation (RestAssured) test fails due to token expiration.** | Implement token refresh mechanism before every test or store token in a reusable setup method. |

---

## üß† 3. Hybrid Scenarios (Manual + Automation)

| **Scenario** | **Answer** |
| --- | --- |
| **1\. How do you decide what to automate?** | Repetitive, stable, high regression value test cases ‚Äî like login, CRUD operations, or smoke tests. Avoid unstable or UI-changing modules. |
| **2\. A test case is failing after new deployment. How will you confirm it‚Äôs not automation issue?** | Re-run manually, compare actual behavior with expected. Check locator or data change. If valid manually, then debug automation script. |
| **3\. How to handle test data dependency between manual and automation?** | Use common test data repository (Excel, DB, or JSON). Use environment-specific data management strategy. |
| **4\. How will you validate backend with automation?** | Use SQL queries to verify DB records or API responses. Combine Selenium + JDBC/RestAssured. |
| **5\. What challenges you faced in automation testing?** | \- Dynamic elements |

* Synchronization issues
    
* Browser compatibility
    
* CI/CD setup
